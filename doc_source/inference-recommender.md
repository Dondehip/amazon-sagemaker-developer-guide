# Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender<a name="inference-recommender"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender is a new capability of Amazon SageMaker that reduces the time required to get machine learning \(ML\) models in production by automating load testing and model tuning across SageMaker ML instances\. You can use Inference Recommender to deploy your model to a real\-time inference endpoint that delivers the best performance at the lowest cost\. Inference Recommender helps you select the best instance type and configuration \(such as instance count, container parameters, and model optimizations\) for your ML models and workloads\.

Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender only charges you for the instances used while your jobs are executing\.

## How it Works<a name="inference-recommender-how-it-works"></a>

To use Amazon SageMaker Inference Recommender, you must first register a model to SageMaker model registry with your model artifact and container, use AWS SDK for Python \(Boto3\) to benchmark different SageMaker endpoint configurations, collect metrics, and visualize metrics across performance and resource utilization to help you decide on which instance type to choose\.
