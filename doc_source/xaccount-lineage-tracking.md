# Cross\-Account Lineage Tracking<a name="xaccount-lineage-tracking"></a>

Amazon SageMaker supports tracking lineage entities from a different AWS account\. Other AWS accounts can share their lineage entities with you and you can access these lineage entities through direct API calls or SageMaker lineage queries\.

SageMaker uses [AWS Resource Access Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) to help you securely share your lineage resources\. You can share your resources through the [AWS RAM console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home)\.



## Set Up Cross\-Account Lineage Tracking<a name="setup-xaccount-lineage-tracking"></a>

You can group and share your [ Lineage Tracking EntitiesTracking Entities Tracking entities maintain a representation of all the elements of your end\-to\-end machine learning workflow\. You can use this representation to establish model governance, reproduce your workflow, and maintain a record of your work history\.  Tracking entities maintain a representation of all the elements of your end\-to\-end machine learning workflow\. You can use this representation to establish model governance, reproduce your workflow, and maintain a record of your work history\. Amazon SageMaker automatically creates tracking entities for trial components and their associated trials and experiments when you create SageMaker jobs such as processing jobs, training jobs, and batch transform jobs\. In additional to auto tracking, you can also [Manually Create Tracking Entities](lineage-tracking-manual-creation.md) to model custom steps in your workflow\. For more information, see [Manage Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker Experiments](experiments.md)\. SageMaker also automatically creates tracking entities for the other steps in a workflow so you can track the workflow from end to end\. For more information, see [Amazon SageMaker–Created Tracking Entities](lineage-tracking-auto-creation.md)\. You can create additional entities to supplement those created by SageMaker\. For more information, see [Manually Create Tracking Entities](lineage-tracking-manual-creation.md)\. SageMaker reuses any existing entities rather than creating new ones\. For example, there can be only one artifact with a unique `SourceUri`\.  Key concepts for querying lineage **Lineage** – Metadata that tracks the relationships between various entities in your ML workflows\. **QueryLineage** – The action to inspect your lineage and discover relationships between entities\. **Lineage entities** – The metadata elements of which your lineage is composed\. **Cross\-account lineage** – Your ML workflow may span more than one account\. With cross\-account lineage, you can configure multiple accounts to automatically create lineage associations between shared entity resources\. QueryLineage then can return entities even from these shared accounts\.  The following tracking entities are defined:  Experiment entities  [Trial component](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrialComponent.html) – A stage of a machine learning trial\. Includes processing jobs, training jobs, and batch transform jobs\.   [Trial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrial.html) – A combination of trial components that generally produces a model\.   [Experiment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateExperiment.html) – A grouping of trials generally focused on solving a specific use case\.    Lineage entities  [Trial Component](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateTrialComponent.html) – Represents processing, training, and transform jobs in the lineage\. Also part of experiment management\.   [Context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateContext.html) – Provides a logical grouping of other tracking or experiment entities\. Conceptually, experiments and trials are contexts\. Some examples are an endpoint and a model package\.   [Action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAction.html) – Represents an action or activity\. Generally, an action involves at least one input artifact or output artifact\. Some examples are a workflow step and a model deployment\.   [Artifact](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_CreateArtifact.html) – Represents a URI addressable object or data\. An artifact is generally either an input or an output to a trial component or action\. Some examples include a dataset \(S3 bucket URI\), or an image \(Amazon ECR registry path\)\.   [Association](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AddAssociation.html) – Links other tracking or experiment entities, such as an association between the location of training data and a training job\.  An association has an optional `AssociationType` property\. The following values are available along with the suggested use for each type\. SageMaker places no restrictions on their use:   `ContributedTo` – The source contributed to the destination or had a part in enabling the destination\. For example, the training data contributed to the training job\.   `AssociatedWith` – The source is connected to the destination\. For example, an approval workflow is associated with a model deployment\.   `DerivedFrom` \- The destination is a modification of the source\. For example, a digest output of a channel input for a processing job is derived from the original inputs\.   `Produced` – The source generated the destination\. For example, a training job produced a model artifact\.   `SameAs` – When the same lineage entity used in different accounts\.     **Common properties**   **Type property** The action, artifact, and context entities have a *type* property, `ActionType`, `ArtifactType`, and `ContextType`, respectively\. This property is a custom string which can associate meaningful information with the entity and be used as a filter in the List APIs\.   **Source property** The action, artifact, and context entities have a `Source` property\. This property provides the underlying URI that the entity represents\. Some examples are:   An `UpdateEndpoint` action where the source is the `EndpointArn`\.   An image artifact for a processing job where the source is the `ImageUri`\.   An `Endpoint` context where the source is the `EndpointArn`\.     **Metadata property** The action and artifact entities have an optional `Metadata` property which can provide the following information:   `ProjectId` – For example, the ID of the SageMaker MLOps project to which a model belongs\.   `GeneratedBy` – For example, the SageMaker pipeline execution that registered a model package version\.   `Repository` – For example, the repository that contains an algorithm\.   `CommitId` – For example, the commit ID of an algorithm version\.     ](lineage-tracking-entities.md) through a lineage group in Amazon SageMaker\. SageMaker supports only one default lineage group per account\. SageMaker creates the default lineage group whenever a lineage entity is created in your account\. Every lineage entity owned by your account is assigned to this default lineage group\. To share lineage entities with another account, you share this default lineage group with that account\.

**Note**  
You can share all lineage tracking entities in a lineage group or none\.

Create a resource share for your lineage entities using AWS Resource Access Manager console\. For more information, see [Sharing your AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html) in the *AWS Resource Access Manager User Guide*\.

**Note**  
After the resource share is created, it can take a few minutes for the resource and principal associations to complete\. Once the association is set, the shared account receives an invitation to join the resource share\. The shared account must accept the invite to gain access to shared resources\. For more information on accepting a resource share invite in AWS RAM, see [Using shared AWS resources ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-shared.html) in the *AWS Resource Access Manager User Guide*\.

### Your cross\-account lineage tracking resource policy<a name="setup-xaccount-lineage-tracking"></a>

Amazon SageMaker supports only one type of resource policy\. The SageMaker resource policy must allow all of the following operations:

```
"sagemaker:DescribeAction"
"sagemaker:DescribeArtifact"
"sagemaker:DescribeContext"
"sagemaker:DescribeTrialComponent"
"sagemaker:AddAssociation"
"sagemaker:DeleteAssociation"
"sagemaker:QueryLineage"
```

**Example The following is a SageMaker resource policy created using AWS Resource Access Manager for creating a resource share for an accounts lineage group\.**  

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "FullLineageAccess",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "123456789012" #account-id
      },
      "Action": [
        "sagemaker:DescribeAction",
        "sagemaker:DescribeArtifact",
        "sagemaker:DescribeContext",
        "sagemaker:DescribeTrialComponent",
        "sagemaker:AddAssociation",
        "sagemaker:DeleteAssociation",
        "sagemaker:QueryLineage"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sagemaker:us-west-2:111111111111:lineage-group/sagemaker-default-lineage-group" #Sample lineage group resource 
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tracking Cross\-Account Lineage Entities<a name="tracking-lineage-xaccount"></a>

With cross\-account lineage tracking you can associate lineage entities in different accounts using the same `AddAssociation` API action\. When you associate two lineage entities, SageMaker validates if you have permissions to perform the `AddAssociation` API action on both lineage entities\. SageMaker then establishes the association\. If you don’t have the permissions, SageMaker *does not* create the association\. Once the cross\-account association is established, you can access either lineage entity from the other through the `QueryLineage` API action\. For more information, see [Querying Lineage Entities](querying-lineage-entities.md)\.

In addition to SageMaker automatically creating lineage entities, if you have cross\-account access, SageMaker connects artifacts that reference the same object or data\. If the data from one account is used in lineage tracking by different accounts, SageMaker creates an artifact in each account to track that data\. With cross\-account lineage, whenever SageMaker creates new artifacts, SageMaker checks if there are other artifacts created for the same data that are also shared with you\. SageMaker then establishes associations between the newly created artifact and each of the artifacts shared with you with the `AssociationType` set to `SameAs`\. You can then use the `[QueryLineage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_QueryLineage.html)` API action to traverse the lineage entities in your own account to lineage entities shared with you but owned by a different AWS account\. For more information, see [Querying Lineage Entities](querying-lineage-entities.md)

### Accessing lineage resources from a different accounts<a name="tracking-lineage-xaccount-accessing-resources"></a>

Once the cross\-account access for sharing lineage has been set up, you can call the following SageMaker API actions directly with the ARN to describe the shared lineage entities from another account:
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAction.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAction.html)
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeArtifact.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeArtifact.html)
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContext.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeContext.html)
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTrialComponent.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeTrialComponent.html)

You can also manage [Associations ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/lineage-tracking-entities.html)for lineage entities owned by different accounts that are shared with you, using the following SageMaker API actions: 
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AddAssociation.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_AddAssociation.html)
+ [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteAssociation.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/APIReference/API_DeleteAssociation.html)

For a notebook that demonstrates how to use SageMaker Lineage APIs to query lineage across accounts\., see [sagemaker\-lineage\-cross\-account\-with\-ram\.ipynb](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/sagemaker-lineage/sagemaker-lineage-cross-account-with-ram.ipynb)\.

### Authorization for querying cross\-account lineage entities<a name="tracking-lineage-xaccount-authorization"></a>

Amazon SageMaker must validate that you have permissions to perform the `QueryLineage` API action on the `StartArns`\. This is enforced through the resource policy attached to the `LineageGroup`\.  The result from this action includes all the lineage entities to which you have access, whether they are owned by your account or shared by another account\. For more information, see [Querying Lineage Entities](querying-lineage-entities.md)\.
