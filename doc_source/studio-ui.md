# Amazon SageMaker Studio UI Overview<a name="studio-ui"></a>

Amazon SageMaker Studio extends the JupyterLab interface\. Previous users of JupyterLab will notice the similarity of the user interface, including the workspace\. Studio adds many additions to the interface\. The most prominent additions are detailed in the following sections\. For an overview of the basic JupyterLab interface, see [The JupyterLab Interface](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/interface.html)\.

The following image shows SageMaker Studio with the file browser open and the Studio Launcher displayed\.
