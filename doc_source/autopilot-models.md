# Models generated by Amazon SageMaker Autopilot<a name="autopilot-models"></a>

This procedure describes how to view details about Amazon SageMaker Autopilot jobs that you have run\. Details provided about the candidate models generated by Autopilot include:
+ A plot of the aggregated SHAP values that indicate the importance of each feature to help explain your models predictions\.
+ The summary statistics for various training and validation metrics, including the objective metric\.
+ A list of the hyperparameters used to train and tune the model\.

**Note**  
This topic assumes that you have already created and run an Autopilot experiment\. For information on how to create an Autopilot experiment, see [Create an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot experiment](autopilot-automate-model-development-create-experiment.md) 

**Note**  
To access the feature importance metrics in this procedure, you must first select **File > Shut down**, and then restart Studio from the console\.

1. To view model details after running an Amazon SageMaker Autopilot job, choose the SageMaker resources icon ![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/images/autopilot/autopilot-models-details-triangular-icon.PNG) from the left sidebar to open the **SageMaker resources** panel\.

1. Select **Experiments and trials** from the dropdown menu located underneath SageMaker resources\.

1. Locate the Autopilot job whose details that you want to examine in the **Unassigned trial components** list\. Right\-click over the name of the job and select **Describe AutoML Job** from the pop\-up menu\. This opens a new **Autopilot job** tab\.

1. The **Autopilot job** panel lists the **Objective** metric values for each model in the job with the **Best model** at the top of the **Trials** tab\. To review model details, right click over the model that you are interested in and select **Open in model details**\. This opens a new **Model Details** tab\.

1. In ** Model Details**, the top of the Explainability tab contains a plot of aggregated SHAP values that indicate the importance of each feature, followed by hyper parameter values for this model\. The **Performance** tab contains metrics statistics and a confusion matrix\. The **Artifacts** tab contains information about model inputs, outputs and intermediate results\. The **Network** tab summarizes your network isolation and encryption choices\.
**Note**  
Feature importance and information in the **Performance** tab is only generated for the **Best model**\.
