Accepting a batch informs your AWS expert to continue or complete the project, based on the number of remaining images you contracted\.

When you reject a batch, an AWS expert contacts you to determine the rework process and the next steps for the batch\.

Accepting or rejecting a batch is a one\-time action and can only be undone by contacting your AWS expert\. It is necessary to either accept or reject every batch of the project\.

**Note**  
 Once a project is completed, you can delete the project\. Deleting the project does not delete the images from your S3 bucket\. To learn more about deleting images from you S3 bucket, refer to [Deleting Amazon S3 objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/DeletingObjects.html)\.
